Changelog
=========

2.12.7 (unreleased)
-------------------

- Added forward compatibility with DateTime 3 pickle format. DateTime
  instances constructed under version 3 can be read and unpickled by this
  version. The pickled data is converted to the current versions format
  (old-style class / no slots). Once converted it will be stored again in the
  old format. This should allow for a transparent upgrade/downgrade path
  between DateTime 2 and 3.

2.12.6 (2010-10-17)
-------------------

- Changed ``testDayOfWeek`` test to be independent of OS locale.

2.12.5 (2010-07-29)
-------------------

- Launchpad #143269: Corrected the documentation for year value 
  behavior when constructing a DateTime object with three numeric 
  arguments.

- Launchpad #142521: Removed confusing special case in 
  DateTime.__str__ where DateTime instances for midnight 
  (e.g. '2010-07-27 00:00:00 US/Eastern') values would 
  render only their date and nothing else.

2.12.4 (2010-07-12)
-------------------

- Fixed mapping of EDT (was -> 'GMT-0400', now 'GMT-4').

2.12.3 (2010-07-09)
-------------------

- Added EDT timezone support. Addresses bug #599856.

2.12.2 (2010-05-05)
-------------------

- Launchpad #572715:  Relaxed pin on pytz, after applying a patch from 
  Marius Gedminus which fixes the apparent API breakage.

2.12.1 (2010-04-30)
-------------------

- Removed an undeclared testing dependency on zope.testing.doctest in favor of
  the standard libraries doctest module.

- Added a maximum version requirement on pytz <= 2010b. Later versions produce
  test failures related to timezone changes.

2.12.0 (2009-03-04)
-------------------

- Launchpad #290254: Forward-ported fix for '_micros'-less pickles from
  the Zope 2.11 branch version.

2.11.2 (2009-02-02)
-------------------

- Include *all* pytz zone names, not just "common" ones.

- Fix one fragile doctest, band-aid another.

- Fix for launchpad #267545: DateTime(DateTime()) should preserve the
  correct hour.

2.11.1 (2008-08-05)
-------------------

- DateTime conversion of datetime objects with non-pytz tzinfo. Timezones()
  returns a copy of the timezone list (allows tests to run).

- Merged the slinkp-datetime-200007 branch: fix the DateTime(anotherDateTime)
  constructor to preserve timezones.

2.11.0b1 (2008-01-06)
---------------------

- Split off from the Zope2 main source code tree.
